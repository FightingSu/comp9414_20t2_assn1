# COMP 9414 Assignment 1

This assignment requires us to manage tasks with given constraints. These types of problems are called the *Constraint Satisfaction Problems*, which means to find a solution that can satisfy all the constraints. 

In this assignment, we modelled the task management problem into a constraint satisfaction problem, and tries to implement a heuristic searching method (A\* search) to find a solution for given task. If no solution were found, return nothing.

## Description

In this assignment, we are going to read input files describing different tasks and output result into another file. Most of files are from `AIPython`, provided necessary libraries. The  `run_test.sh` is a test script and `fuzzyScheduler.py` contains the model and performs the searching.

There is a detailed description in `assignment1.pdf`
